\chapter[Degree Program]{What to Call your Degree Program on your Title Page and your Abstract Page}
\label{app:degree-program}

\paragraph{Title page}
The second line (or second and third lines) on the page must name your \emph{administrative unit}.

\begin{itemize}
\item If your degree is offered by one department of Arts \& Sciences on the Danforth Campus, your unit is that department: \\
\centerline{\emph{Department of East Asian Languages \& Cultures}}

\item For a co-sponsored degree such as English \& Comparative Literature, credit both: \\
\centerline{\emph{Department of English}}\\
\centerline{\emph{Program in Comparative Literature}}

\item For the Division of Biology \& Biomedical Sciences, credit DBBS and your program: \\
\centerline{\emph{Division of Biology \& Biomedical Sciences}}\\
\centerline{\emph{Neurosciences}}

\item Credit only the program for any of the non-DBBS PhDs on the Medical Campus: \\
\centerline{\emph{Interdisciplinary Program in Movement Science}}\\
\centerline{or}\\
\centerline{\emph{Program in Speech \& Hearing Sciences}}

\item If you are in a department in Engineering, credit the School and the department: \\
\centerline{\emph{School of Engineering \& Applied Science}}\\
\centerline{\emph{Department of Biomedical Engineering}}

\item If you are in social work or business, your administrative unit is the School: \\
\centerline{\emph{Brown School of Social Work}}\\
\centerline{or}\\
\centerline{\emph{Olin Business School}}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Abstract page}
Frequent confusion occurs because your abstract heading names your degree rather than your administrative unit, so it may – or may not – match your title page in that respect.

\begin{itemize}
\item For the Division of Biology \& Biomedical Sciences: \\
\centerline{\emph{Doctor of Philosophy in Biology and Biomedical Sciences}}\\
\centerline{\emph{Neurosciences}}

\item For a co-sponsored degree such as English \& Comparative Literature, credit both: \\
\centerline{\emph{Doctor of Philosophy in English and Comparative Literature}}

\item If you are in a department in Engineering, credit the School and the department: \\
\centerline{\emph{School of Engineering \& Applied Science}}\\
\centerline{\emph{Department of Biomedical Engineering}}

\item If your degree is offered by one department of Arts \& Sciences on the Danforth Campus: \\
\centerline{\emph{Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry}}
\end{itemize}
