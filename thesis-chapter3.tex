Place recognition, the task of identifying the specific location seen in a image, is often formulated as an image retrieval task, where images with known locations serve as a database, and a query image's location is inferred by finding visually similar images in that database~\cite{baatz2012large,chen2011city,crandall2009mapping,hays2008im2gps,jacobs07geolocate,schindler2007city,torii2013visual,zamir2010accurate,googleLandmarks}. Increasingly, the similarity metrics used in these place recognition tasks are computed using features extracted from deep neural networks trained to produce similar features for images from nearby locations~\cite{zhou2014recognizing,netvlad,visualPlaceRecognition,vo2017revisit,zhai2018geotemporal}.
